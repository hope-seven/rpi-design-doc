    name: 'Comparative Analysis',
    content:
        'Comparative analysis is a reflective process by which UX teams venture into the realm of similar products or services to learn what they are doing well and where they can improve. Instead of beginning from the ground up, this method allows designers to look for patterns in functionality, design, and usability. For example, by examining the way various apps handle onboarding or navigation, a team will learn about conventions in the field and discover how to innovate away from them. This kind of analysis isn\'t simply calling out what the competition is doing—this is offering inspiration, avoiding design errors, and enabling teams to craft specific and user-focused experiences.',

    name: 'Card Sorting',
    content:
        'Card sorting is a hands-on, group exercise that uncovers the way users mentally group and label information. Done either with physical cards or with digital tools, individuals are asked to categorize labeled subject or characteristics into meaningful categories to them. It gives designers a view of what actual people think and structure, especially useful for designing navigation menus, product categories, or content-heavy pages. By aligning a product\'s structure to users\' needs, card sorting enables individuals to find what they\'re looking for more easily—creating more fluid, more natural experiences.',

    name: 'Customer Survey',
    content:
        'Customer surveys are likely the most scalable way to listen to large numbers of people. When designed well, surveys allow teams to discover who their users are, what they need, and how they feel about a product or service. They can include rating scales and checkboxes to collect quantifiable data, as well as open questions to gather personal stories and qualitative feedback. Surveys are especially good at identifying trends, validating design hypotheses, and guiding prioritization. If you’re deciding what to build next, or trying to identify user pain points, surveys bring the voice of the user right into your decision-making.',

  PrincipleModel(
    id: '4',
    name: 'Tree Testing',
    content:
        'Tree testing is like shining a light on your site’s navigation hierarchy—before adding any visuals. Users are shown a plain version of the site’s hierarchy (text only, no layout) and asked to locate particular items or perform tasks. It’s a way to determine if your labels and questions make sense independently. The data collected—such as which routes users take, where they get stuck, and how long it takes them—gives clear evidence of what’s working and what doesn’t. By solving these issues early on, teams can save time, reduce user frustration, and avoid costly overhauls later.',

    name: 'User Persona',
    content:
        'User personas bring research to life by representing real types of users in the form of believable, fictional characters. Each persona contains a name, an image, and a narrative that embodies real user objectives, activities, and pain points. They’re not placebos—they serve as beacons of guidance during design, keeping teams focused on the user. An example might be a working parent with little time to spare, who loves simplicity and quickness, prompting designers to keep things efficient in the UI. By making decisions based on human stories, personas help to create empathy and prevent design decisions based on vague assumptions.',

    name: 'Customer Journey',
    content:
        'Customer journey mapping is a storytelling method that charts the entire journey a user takes with a product or service—from spark of initial interest to post-purchase interaction. Maps indicate the actions users perform, the emotions they feel, and the challenges they encounter in between. Each touch point is examined—like discovering the product, signing up, activating features, or reaching out to support. By plotting the user’s emotional highs and lows, teams can identify where to increase satisfaction, reduce friction, and create a more resonant and meaningful experience in each step.',

  PrincipleModel(
    id: '7',
    name: 'A/B Testing',
    content:
        'A/B testing is like conducting a controlled experiment on your design choices. You create two versions of an element, e.g., a "Buy Now" button red or blue, and show them to different groups of users. The system then compares which of the two performs better according to some measure such as clicks or sign-ups. This is very useful when optimizing interfaces because it removes personal opinions and guesses. Instead of guessing what will or won’t work, A/B testing provides clear, fact-based answers so teams can optimize and improve their products over and over again in real contexts.',

    name: 'Voice of Customer',
    content:
        'Voice of Customer analysis is all about listening—carefully—to what customers are saying, in their own words. This method gathers opinions from various sources, such as helpdesk inquiries, social media posts, chat sessions, or product reviews, and summarizes them into themes and insights. Rather than waiting for users to respond to official surveys, VoC eavesdrops on natural conversations to discover what matters most to them. Whether it’s a repeat issue, a feature request, or praise for a smooth ride, VoC helps you prioritize changes that resonate strongly with the people who actually use your product.',

    name: 'Gestalt Principles',
    content:
        'Gestalt Principles are psychological and help designers understand how people inherently process visual information. These principles—proximity, similarity, and closure—guide how we group elements together, determine patterns, and make sense of what we see. For instance, when buttons are grouped together, users perceive that they’re linked (proximity). When icons look similar, users perceive consistency and predictability (similarity). And when we look at an incomplete shape, our brains fill in the gaps automatically (closure). Applying these rules makes designs intuitive and lovely—not just because they’re pretty, but because they’re aligned with how our brains are designed to see visuals',
