By examining how others solve problems, teams can learn what works well and avoid repeating mistakes. This process helps inspire ideas while ensuring designs align with what users already expect from familiar tools or systems.',

This helps design menus, navigation, or content layouts that feel intuitive, reducing confusion and making it easier for users to find what they need.',
